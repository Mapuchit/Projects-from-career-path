## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices writing Python functions from the Python 3 Course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
The files [nile.py](https://github.com/Mapuchit/Projects-from-career-path/blob/master/21.%20The%20Nile%20-%20Function%20Arguments/nile.py) and [test.py](https://github.com/Mapuchit/Projects-from-career-path/blob/master/21.%20The%20Nile%20-%20Function%20Arguments/test.py) were provided as part of the exercise.
