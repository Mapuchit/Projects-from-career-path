# Towers of Hanoi - Blossom - Hashmap Data Structure
> Implementation of a hashmap that stores the names of flowers and their meanings, and allows quick and easy lookup.

## General info
Practice the hashmap data structure and Python classes to create a dictionary that uses separate chaining with linked lists to avoid collision.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.6 
* Git Bash 2.27.0
* Atom v1.49.0
* Windows 10 Pro

## Features
* A iterable Linked List class and a Node class to implement the separate chaining.
* A Hashmap class that uses a list with a set limit to model the behaviour of an array.
  * Methods to hash and compress the keys of the hashmap.
  * Methods to assign and retrieve a key and it's value from the hashmap.
  * Iterate through the linked list when assigning or retrieving a key.
* Displays "Flower not found!" if key is not found in hashmap.

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices hashmap data structure from the Computer Science Carreer Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
