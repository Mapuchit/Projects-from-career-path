# Searchcademy - Search Algorithms
> Test a company's search engine by finding a target value in a sorted dataset that contains empty data.

## General info
Implement a modified version of iterative binary search to search through a sparsely sorted dataset.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.6
* Git Bash 2.27.0
* Atom v1.49.0
* Windows 10 Pro

## Features
* A Sparse Search function that uses iterative binary search to find a target value.
* Modify algorithm to continuously check for empty values in the dataset.
* Use pointers to keep track of slice of dataset being searched.
* After each iteration the slice of dataset being searched is divided by half resulting in runtime O(log(N)).
* Display message if value is not found in dataset.

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices search algorithms from the Computer Science Carreer Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
