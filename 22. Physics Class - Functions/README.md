# Physics Class - Python Functions
> Practice writing and calling python functions, using variables and function arguments.

## General info
A collection of functions to calculate physical properties.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.6
* Git Bash 2.27.0
* Atom v1.49.0
* Windows 10 Pro

## Features
* Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa.
* Calculate force (F) from given values of mass (m) and acceleration (a).
* Calculate energy (E) from given value of mass (m).
* Calculate work (W) from given values of mass (m), acceleration (a) and distance (d).
* Print the results using string concatenation and casting numbers to strings.

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices writing Python functions from the Computer Science Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
