# A Sorted Tale - Sorting Algorithms
> Organize the bookshelves of a bookstore by different criteria.

## General info
Implement sorting algorithms to organize the books stored in a .csv file.
Compare the performance of bubble sort and quicksort when executing the same task.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.6
  * csv module 
  * random module 
* Git Bash 2.27.0
* Atom v1.49.0
* Windows 10 Pro

## Features
* Load the books from the .csv file using DictReader and convert all casing to lower case for ease of use.
* Implementation of a bubble sort algorithm and a quicksort algorithm.
* Modify both sorting algorithms to take a comparison function as an additional argument.
* Sort a the elements of a Python dictionary and not just an array.
* Flexibly choose between different sorting criteria such as: 
  * ascending order by title
  * ascending order by author
  * the sum of characters in the author name and title.
* Count the number of swaps done by both sorting algorithms to compare their efficacy performing the same task.

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
This is a guided project that practices sorting algorithms from the Computer Science Carreer Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
