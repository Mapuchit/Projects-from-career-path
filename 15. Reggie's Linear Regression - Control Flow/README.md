# Reggie's Linear Regression - Control Flow
> Implement linear regression to find the ideal bouncy ball size for a ball pit.

## General info
Practice Python control flow, lists and loops.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.6
* Git Bash 2.27.0
* Atom v1.49.0
* Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3
* Windows 10 Pro

## Features
* Use dataset of measurements that compares the size of a ball to it's bounce height.
* Calculate how much error a line produces when fit to these datapoints.
* Find the line that produces the smallest error for these datapoints.
* Use the best fit line to predict the bounce height of balls with different sizes.

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
This is a Jupyter Notebook project that practices Python control flow from the Python 3 Course on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn).
